HOW TO MAKE SYSOUT ON SUN

Osamu Nakamura; KSPA; Fuji Xerox
February 20, 1990

This will describe the method to make SYSOUT on Sun.

Until now, it was only possible to make SYSOUT using Dorado.
It was not possible to create SYSOUT using FX without Dorado (NOTE: "without possessing Dorado?"),
and, regarding (NOTE: "even considering?") Venue, when considering the longevity of Dorado
the possibility of creating SYSOUT using Sun is incredibly important.

Currently (this time), due to the leadership/guidance of Venue's John D. Sybalsky
we report the possibility of creating SYSOUT with Sun.


Required Files

1. The MAKEINIT/LOADUP shell script along with any files needed by that shell script.
Place these files in the /SUNLOADUP directory.

* runloadup
* FILESETS
* INIT,MAKEINIT
* XREM,CM;1
* LOADUP-REM,CM;
* LOADUP,LISP;

2. Medley Emulator

* General emulator (LDE below)
* INIT-specific (NOTE: "special purpose?") emulator (INITLDE below)

Using MAKEINIT produce the INIT,DLINIT specialized (NOTE: same question as with "specific" above) emulators

3. All compiled files making up LISP,SYSOUT
(all Lispcore/sources files)

4. Medley emulator source files (including the makefile) 
(if INITLDE already exists, these are unnecessary)

1. Making INITLDE

Using the INITLDE-specific makefile makeinitlde,
create INITLDE.

Place INITLDE's object file and the executable in the
$YOURWORKDIR/init.$ARCH/ directory and 

The make procedure is as follows:

  prompt% mkdir $YOURWORKDIR/init.$ARCH
    (for $ARCH: if sun4 use "sparc," if sun3 use "mc68020")
  prompt% cd $YOURWORKDIR/bin 
  prompt% makeinitlde -e
    (confirm that the flag -DINIT is included in your compiler message (NOTE: <- some of this text is blacked out, this is my best guess))

This should produce INITLDE '$YOURWORKDIR/init.$ARCH/lde'.

WARNING: Regarding the INITLDE produced with the above procedure, the frame buffer cannot be executed on a cg3,cg6 machine.
To build an INITLDE that can be run on a cg3,cg6 machine, add -DDISPLAYBUFFER to the makeinitlde OPTFLAGS,
remove all object files from the $YOURWORKINGDIR/init.$ARCH directory, and run makeinitlde -e.

2. Editing of MAKEINIT/LOADUP shell script and other files

Venue's (NOTE: THIS NEXT WORD IS BLACK IN TWO PLACES AND IS PROBABLY SOMETHING SPECIFIC AND TECHNICAL..."Venue's _") is configured using the MAKEINIT/LOADUP files. Accordingly Venue's _ (NOTE: again, blacked out characters) saved configuration section has to be edited to be used, the relevant sections described below (NOTE: <- this whole paragraph is a rough translation as there was a lot of black, but I think this is roughly it):

FILE:runloadup
set LDE
(...hopefully you can read this so I'm not going to re-type it out)
...
set SECOND<-REM<-CM

FILE:INIT,MAKEINIT
DIRECTORIES value
passname (NOTE: password? Transliterated from katakana this is "passname:" パスネーム) for the FILESETS LOAD
passname for the FASTINIT.DFASL LOAD
MAKEINIT's fourth parameter (NOTE: guessing that the word is "parameter" here) 
DLFIXINIT's third parameter (NOTE: still guessing as above)

FILE: LOADUP-REM.CM
LOADUP.LISP's LOAD password ("passname" again)
