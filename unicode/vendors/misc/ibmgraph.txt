#
#	General notes:
#
#	This table contains the data the Unicode Consortium has on how
#       IBM PC memory-mapped video graphics map into Unicode. These are
#	the characters commonly seen in positions 0x01..0x1F and 0x7F in
#	IBM PC code pages (e.g. code page 437, 850, etc.)
#
#	Format:  Four tab-separated columns
#		 Column #1 is the Unicode value (in hex as XXXX)
#		 Column #2 is the general IBM PC code page values
#			for 0x01..0x1F, 0x7F (in hex as XX). For completeness,
#			Unicode values which only appear as memory-mapped
#			video graphics in code page 864 are shown with their
#			standard PC code page values here as well.
#		 Column #3 is specific to IBM PC code page 864 (Arabic)
#		 Column #4 the Unicode name (follows a comment sign, '#')
#
#	The entries are in Unicode order.
#
#	Any comments or problems, contact <kenw@sybase.com>.
#	This table is provided by The Unicode Consortium and is
#	not an IBM-supplied mapping.
