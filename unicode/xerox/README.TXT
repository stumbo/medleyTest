The XCCS files contain mappings from the Xerox Character Code Standard (version XC1-3-3-0, 1987) into Unicode 3.0. standard codes.  That is the version of XCCS that corresponds to the (incomplete) fonts in the Medley system.  Unlike the mappings in sister directories, the Xerox mappings did not come from the Unicode CDROM, they were constructed by adjudicating information from the binary file XCCStoUni (of unknown provenance; see below) with code mappings scraped in July 2020 from the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Character_Code_Standard.
 
Both sources are errorful and incomplete, so the original data was inspected and modified by hand. The data here may be the currently best specification of these mapping, but the mappings may still contain errors--no guarantees.  Obviously, the reverse mappings from Unicode to XCCS are by definition incomplete.

Each file may contain the mappings for one or more XCCS character sets.  By convention, the name of the file indicates the character set mappings it contains.  A file with a single mapping has a name of the form XCCS-<csnumber>=<csname>.TXT, where csnumber is the octal number of the character set and csname is a cover term for its mappings.  For example, XCCS-341=HEBREW.TXT contains the mappings for Hebrew.

If a file contains several character sets, its name specifies just the numbers of those sets. For example, XCCS-0,41-50,340-344,356-361.TXT contains mappings for character set 0, 41 through 50, 340 through 344, and 356 through 361 (basically, all the non JIS character sets).

The format of each file conforms to the format of the other Unicode-supplied mapping files:
    Three white-space (tab or spaces) separated columns:
        Column 1 is the XCCS code (as hex 0xXXXX)
        Column 2 is the corresponding Unicode (as hex 0xXXXX)
        Column 3 (after #) is a comment column.
            For convenience, it contains the Unicode character itself (since the
            Unicode character names are not available).

Unicode FFFF is used for the piece-meal (as opposed to systematic) undefined XCCS codes (Column 3 is UNDEFINED). (Long runs of undefined codes may not be explicitly marked.)  Presumably undefined XCCS codes will never appear in XCCS files.

Unicode FFFE is used for defined XCCS codes whose Unicode mapping has not been determined (Column 3 is MISSING). These may be rare, but until/unless these are filled in, XCCS documents contain them them will not be properly represented in Unicode.  Thus, this value flags the need for additional Unicode sleuthing. 

Like the other Unicode mapping files, this file can be read by common Unicode routines. Also, it is encoded in UTF8, so that the Unicode characters are properly displayed in Column 3 and can be edited by standard Unicode-enabled editors (e.g. Mac Textedit).

These files and the mapping files in sister directories can also be read by the function READ-UNICODE-MAPPING in the UNICODE Medley library package, and they can be written by WRITE-UNICODE-MAPPING.

The entries are in XCCS order and grouped by character sets.  In front of each character set, for convenience, there is a #-comment line with the octal XCCS character set and the character-set name (e.g. #  "341" HEBREW).

Note that a given XCCS code might map to codes in several different Unicode positions, since there are repetitions in the Unicode standard.

-------

The source of the file XCCStoUni is unknown, and there is no specification for its structure.  It appears to be a sequence of 2-byte hex Unicode characters with all the Unicode characters in a given character set laid out in ascending XCCS code order.

It seems to have entries only for 188 characters per character set, with no 2-byte cells for the undefined regions of the two 128 code panels of each XCCS character set.  So code 127 is skipped at each panel boundary and the running XCCS code is then bumped by 33.  The hexcode at file position 0 is for octal 41 (exclamation mark); the space 40 isnâ€™t represented.

Within that, Unicode FFFD (the unicode missing-character slug) is used for XCCS codes whose Unicode equivalent is not specified, and it seems that FFFF is used when whole panels are missing (the higher order panel for most of the Japanese).

Finally, no cells are allocated for the unused/reserved character sets (1 through octal 40), so that the Unicode after octal 376 is for 41,41. But the order of character sets is a little jumbled, so that the JIS character sets (60 through 163), for example, start  at 75 (octal) in the file sequence--some higher number character sets appear earlier in the file than they should.

The JIS character sets seem to be complete and accurate. There are sporadic missing codes and errors in some of the other sets that required hand correction.
