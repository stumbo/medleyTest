This Unicode directory contains mapping files extracted from the CDROM that came with the Unicode 3.0 book (2000).

The Xerox subdirectory contains mappings from the Xerox character encoding (version XC1-3-3-0, 1887) into Unicode 3.0.   standard into Unicode.  That is the version of XCCS corresponding to the fonts in the Medley system.  The Xerox mappings did not come from the Unicode CDROM, they were constructed by combining and constrasting information from a binary file (xerox>XCCStoUni) of unknown provenance with code mappings scraped from the Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Character_Code_Standard in July 2020.  Both sources were errorful and incomplete, so many of the mappings were hand corrected.  There are still missing mappings, and there still may be errors.
