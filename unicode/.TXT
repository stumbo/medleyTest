#          Name:             XCCS (XC-3-1-1-0) to Unicode
#          Unicode version:  3.0
#          Table version:    0.1
#          Table format:     Format A

#  This file contains mappings from the Xerox Character Code Standard (version 
#  XC1-3-3-0, 1987) into Unicode 3.0. standard codes.  That is the version of 
#  XCCS corresponding to the fonts in the Medley system.  The Xerox mappings
#  did not come from the Unicode CDROM, they were constructed by combining
#  and constrasting information from a binary file (xerox>XCCStoUni)
#  of unknown provenance with code mappings scraped from the Wikipedia page 
#        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Character_Code_Standard
#  in July 2020.  Both sources were errorful and incomplete, so the original
#  data was inspected and modified by hand. The data here may be the currently
#  best specification of these mapping, but the mappings may still contain
#  errors--no guarantees.  Obviously, the reverse mappings from Unicode to
#  XCCS are by definition incomplete.
#  
#  The file XCCS-NOJIS.TXT excludes the large set of mappings for
#  Japanese characters, it just includes characters thatt are more broadly useful.
#  
#  The JIS mappings are contained in the separate XCCS-JIS.TXT file.
#  The full set of mappings can be creating by appending these two files.
#  
#  The format of this file conforms to the format of the other Unicode-supplied
#  mapping files:
#     Three white-space (tab or spaces) separated columns
#       Column #1 is the XCCS code (as hex 0xXXXX)
#       Column #2 is the corresponding Unicode (as hex 0xXXXX)
#       Column #3 (after #) is a comment column. For convenience, it contains the
#          Unicode character itself (since the Unicode character names
#          are not available)
#  Unicode FFFF is used for undefined XCCS codes
#  Unicode FFFE is used for XCCS codes that have not yet been filled in.
#  
#  Like the other Unicode mapping files, this file can be read by
#  common Unicode routines. Also, it is encoded in UTF8, so that the Unicode characters 
#  are properly displayed on the right side and can be edited by standard 
#  Unicode-enabled editors (e.g. Mac Textedit).
#  
#  This file and the other Unicode mapping files can also be read by the function
#  READ-UNICODE-MAPPING in the UNICODE Medley library package.
#  
#  The entries are in XCCS order and grouped by character sets.  In front of 
#  each character set, for convenience, there is a line with the octal XCCS
#  character set, after #.
#  
#  Note that a given XCCS code might map to codes in several different Unicode
#  positions, since there are repetitions in the Unicode standard.
